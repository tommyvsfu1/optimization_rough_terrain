\section{INTRODUCTION \& MOTIVATION}

(team part)

There are five sections in this template, please follow the sections and feel free to add sub-sections. 

In this section, you need to give an introduction of your team's project started with a couple of sentences that introduce your topic to your readers. You do not have to give too much detailed information, but you should explain why this project is "important".

You should learn some common usage of LaTex, or you can revise this template to your own project proposal.

\section{SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE \& EQUIPMENTS}

(team part)

\subsection{SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE}

This section explains the approaches in both "hardware" or "software systems". You should explain here the key components/modules and they are working together (typically in a flowchart or a system diagram). Wherever possible, the methods and tasks to be performed should be outlined in logical sequence and explained in detail. Do not assume the reviewer will fill in the gaps in your logic. A ROS system diagram generated by rqt\_graph~\cite{rqt-graph} may be useful (you can learn "rqt" easily from google).

\subsection{EQUIPMENTS} 

You should list the hardware which is necessary in your project. Your project will only become For example, duckiebot with a gripper Fig.~\ref{figure:duckiebot_gripper}.
\begin{figure}[h] % h means put this image here
\includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{duckiebot_gripper}
\centering
\caption{Duckiebot with gripper}
 \label{figure:duckiebot_gripper}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[t] % t means put this image at the top 
\includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{duck}
\centering
\caption{Teaser figure: this figure is the most important one in the paper. It gives your readers the first impression of this work. The teaser generally includes the overview of the proposed approach and the key contributions. It appears at the upper right of the first page.}
\end{figure}

\section{SPECIFIC AIMS}

(individual part)

Specific aims need to be concrete enough, so that it is clear what will be the expected outcomes of this work. You also need a reasonable scope that you could finish in this semester.

\begin{itemize}
\item Specific Aim 1.
\item Specific Aim 2.
\end{itemize}

\section{APPROACH}

(individual part)

This section should include the methods that you will need in order to reach the specific aims. You could include how you will implement your software/hardware, the design of the algorithms. Some preliminary results will be helpful as well. 

You may also state what experiments you will carry out to convince the readers that you reach the specific aims.

\section{SCHEDULE AND TEAM COLLABORATION}

(individual part)

In this section you should write a estimated timeline of your project. This schedule will be very crucial to keep up progress for your project. If you are in a team, you're encouraged to add other team members' on the timeline. It will better show the coordination of your team.
   

\addtolength{\textheight}{-12cm}   % This command serves to balance the column lengths
                                  % on the last page of the document manually. It shortens
                                  % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
                                  % This command does not take effect until the next page
                                  % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
                                  % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.
